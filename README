Superbus (name suggestions welcome) is a synchronization bus service for Android.  We've built several projects that need to do background syncing.  This is the functionality that emerged from that.  This is highly slanted towards network communication, but it could in theory be used for architecting a local storage scheduling system (or whatever).

Outside of the core functionality, this is still VERY new.  Comments and feedback highly encouraged.
